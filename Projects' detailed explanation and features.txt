1. CGPA Calculator:

Detailed Description:
The CGPA Calculator is a C++ program designed to assist students in calculating their Semester GPA and Cumulative GPA over
multiple semesters. It allows the user to input course information, including course names, credit hours, and grades. The program
then calculates the GPA for each semester and the overall CGPA, providing a summary report of all courses and their respective grades.

Key Features:
-Grade Validation: The program ensures accurate input by validating that grades are within the range of 0-100.
-Customizable Grading Scale: Grades are converted to a 4.0 scale using a customizable grading system.
-Summary Report: Generates a detailed summary report of the courses and grades for each semester, along with the calculated GPAs.
-User-Friendly Interface: The program includes clear prompts and output formatting for ease of use.

2. Login and Registration System:

Detailed Description:
This project involves creating a basic Login and Registration System in C++ that allows users to register new accounts and log in using
their credentials. The program stores user data in a text file, checking for existing usernames to prevent duplicates and ensuring secure access.

Key Features:
-File Handling: User credentials are securely stored and retrieved from a text file, demonstrating basic file handling in C++.
-Username Verification: The program checks for existing usernames during registration to avoid duplication and prompts users to log in if the username already exists.
-Login Verification: Ensures that users can only log in with the correct password, offering a basic security layer.
-User Interaction: Includes interactive prompts that guide the user through registration and login processes.

3. Sudoku Solver:

Detailed Description:
The Sudoku Solver is a C++ program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles. It provides users with the option to input their own Sudoku grid or select from pre-defined
grids of varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). The program checks the validity of the input grid and uses a backtracking algorithm to find the solution.

Key Features:
-Backtracking Algorithm: Implements a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve the Sudoku puzzle, ensuring that all rows, columns, and sub-grids meet the Sudoku rules.
-Grid Validation: Validates the initial grid to ensure that the puzzle is solvable before attempting to solve it.
-Custom and Pre-defined Grids: Allows users to either input their own puzzle or choose from pre-defined grids with different difficulty levels.
-User Interaction: The program provides a clear interface for users to input and view the Sudoku grid, as well as the solution.
